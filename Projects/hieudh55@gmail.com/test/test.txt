Feature: Login feature
  As an android developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

  Scenario: I can start my app and take main screen's picture # features\my_first.feature:6
    Given I start my app                                      # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:12
    Then I see main menu                                      # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:17
    Then I take a nice picture of my main screen              # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:21

  Scenario: I want to test random number array feature of my app # features\my_first.feature:11
    Given I want to use Counting Sort feature                    # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:25
    Then I enter number of digits i want to sort                 # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:31
    Then I want to get a new random number array                 # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:36

  Scenario: I want to test TimSort feature                           # features\my_first.feature:16
    Given I want to use TimSort feature                              # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:44
    Then I want use TimSort to sort 6 numbers                        # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:48
      No element found for query: TextView marked:'Tim Sort is chosen' (RuntimeError)
      ./features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:50:in `/^I want use TimSort to sort 6 numbers$/'
      features\my_first.feature:18:in `Then I want use TimSort to sort 6 numbers'
    But I dont like this number array, so I chose a new number array # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:55
    Then I see number array after timsort and sort steps             # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:60

  Scenario: Test Merge Sort feature and scroll down              # features\my_first.feature:22
    Given I want to use MergeSort feature                        # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:72
    Then I want to use MergeSort to sort 9 numbers               # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:76
    And I see random number array, I like it so I want to use it # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:83
    Then I see number array after merge sort and sort steps      # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:66
